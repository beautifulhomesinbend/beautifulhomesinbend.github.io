Patti worked very hard to get our house sold.  She went above and beyond in marketing the home and was successful in getting it done in a short time!  Her communication with us during the process was really appreciated.  We felt like she really cared about us and made the transaction go better than we could have hoped for!  Would highly recommend Patti whether buying or selling!

Buying a home in Bend is challenging.  Pricing and occupancy are both high.  We found a knowledgeable and experienced guide in Patti Geraghty.  She’s savvy, personable, and knows the market.
